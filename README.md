# Sea-Mine-Prediction
It's a machine learning project which predicts whether the article found in the Sea is Mine or some random Rock.

This repository includes two files one is Sonar Data file which is dataset for our project whixh I got from Kaggle Platform. The other is main code.
In this project, I have trained the machine learning model using Supervised Learning technique where its a use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. And the model used is Logistic Regression Model.

Workflow of the Project :
 --> Data Collection - the sonar data was collected from Kaggle Platform.
 --> Data Preprocessing - analysis, etc
 --> Train and Test Split 
 --> Which Model to be used? - Logistic Regression, because it works well with Binary classification of data.
 --> Model Training
 --> Model Testing
